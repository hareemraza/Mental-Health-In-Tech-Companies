# Mental-Health-In-Tech-Companies


### Inspiration

The tech industry has observed a tremendous rise over the past decade whereby its growing advancements have made it a dream workplace for people around the globe. Consequently, a large influx of employees is observed in the tech-industry every year. However, the competitive and fast-paced environment does offer its own consequences. In this blog, we analyze the prevalence of mental health issues faced by employees in tech companies and the response from the perspective of both the employees and the companies in terms of the facilities provided to counter it.

### Goals

The driving question for our analysis is whether the organizational culture of tech companies affects the mental health of employees? If so, how do companies and employees respond to such issues? We divide our work into sub-questions such as the ones highlighted below:
- How does the nature of work affect the way an employee faces and responds to mental health issues?
- Does poor mental health affect productivity?
- How open are tech employees about their mental health in their workplace and what factors affect it?
- Do companies and employees differentiate between the way they deal with mental and physical health?
- How does the tech company accommodate its employees with mental health issues?

We will be answering them one by one, building one upon the other, and finally connecting the dots to reach a conclusion. But before that, let's have a quick look at the data we have.

### Dataset

Our dataset, titled “Mental Health in Tech Survey” is obtained from Open Sourcing Mental Illness, LTD. It is based on a single CSV file where each row represents an individual (tech company employee) who was surveyed in 2014 about his/her mental health and its correlation with various attributes.
